## About me

Hi, welcome to my page. I am **Abel Owolabi**, a second-year Ph.D. student in the **Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering** at the **University of Rochester, New York, USA** currently advised by *Distinguished Professor Eby G. Friedman.*

My research focuses on the design and optimization of superconducting and beyond-CMOS digital circuits, with particular emphasis on Dynamic Single Flux Quantum (DSFQ) and Rapid Single Flux Quantum (RSFQ) logic. It investigates clock-free, data-driven architectures, bias-margin optimization, and Josephson-junction-level circuit techniques to improve speed, energy efficiency, and scalability in high-performance cryogenic computing systems.
